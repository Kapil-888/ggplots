## ***Research & Analytics***

## **1. Machine Learning Model for Weather Dataset**
- In building this model I have used 10 cross fold validation of actual weather data set of London 2015-2016.
- Used non linear and advanced models checked through kappa and accuracy values.
### Supervised ML Models Used

- *Classification & Regression Tree (CART)*
- *k-Nearest Neighbours (knn)*
- *Random Forest (rm)*
- *Tree Based Model (rpart)*
- *Support Machine Vector (svm)*

## **2. Statistical Modelling from Webpage**
- Involves scraping data from worldometer website about changes in uk population (2016-2021).
- ggplot for definifing interrelation between variables, designing axis, legends, title, theme, and facets.
### Steps Involved
- *Data Scraping*
- *Data Cleaning*
- *Data Filtering Techniques using tidyverse*
- *Data Manipulation/Wrangling*
- *Reviewing basic plots and stats*
- *10 fold cross validation*
- *Running different algorithms according to relations seen in viz*
- *Finding accuracy and kappa for best fitting model*


## **3. t-tests**
- t-tests are used in analysis in various fields, these tell us if there's truely a statistical difference in our means of one or two groups.
- In this, I have done Single Sample, One sided, Two Sided, & Paired t-tests using gapminder dataset.


## **4. ANOVA:**
- Analysis of variance is used for checking if the difference between 3 or more categorical variables vs a numerical variable is statiscally diffence or could it have been occurred by chance. 
- These can be done for multiple variable as MANOVA (multivariate ANOVA)


## **5. Chi-Square tests**
- It is used for checking differences in propotions of two categorical (discrete) variables. 
- I have here demonstrated two types of chi tests - goodness of fit, & test of independence


## **6. Linear regression Model**
- This form of analysis estimates the coefficients of the linear equation, involving one or more independent variables that best predict the value of the dependent variable or for checking the line of best fit. 


## **7. Gapminder.R**
- Population data of Asia and Europe is taken to explain life expectancy in relation with GDP per capita. 
- Data was visualised as scatterplot and all the packages designed in R.

## **8. Airquality Project.R**
- Used ggplot2 and tidyverse packages in R for determining fluctuations in Ozone levels with the increase in Solar Radiation and subsequent changes in Temperature.
