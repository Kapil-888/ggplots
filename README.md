**1. Machine Learning model for weather forcast**
- In building this model I have used 10 cross fold validation of actual weather data set of London 2015-2016.
- Used non linear and advanced models checked through kappa and accuracy values.

**2. Gapminder.R**
- Population data of Asia and Europe is taken to explain life expectancy in relation with GDP per capita. 
- Data was visualised as scatterplot and all the packages designed in R. 

**3. t-tests**
- t-tests are used in analysis in various fields, these tell us if there's truely a statistical difference in our means of one or two groups.
- In this, I have done Single Sample, One sided, Two Sided, & Paired t-tests using gapminder dataset.

**4. ANOVA:**
- Analysis of variance is used for checking if the difference between 3 or more categorical variables vs a numerical variable is statiscally diffence or could it have been occurred by chance. 
- These can be done for multiple variable as MANOVA (multivariate ANOVA)

**5. Chi-Square tests:**
- It is used for checking differences in propotions of two categorical (discrete) variables. 
- I have here demonstrated two types of chi tests - goodness of fit, & test of independence
