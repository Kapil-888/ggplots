2. Machine Learning model for weather forcast:
- In building this model I have used 10 cross fold validation of actual weather data set of London 2015-2016.
- Used non linear and advanced models checked through kappa and accuracy values.

3. t-tests:
- t-tests are used in analysis in various fields, these tell us if there's truely a statistical difference in our means of one or two groups.
- In this, I have done Single Sample, One sided, Two Sided, & Paired t-tests using gapminder dataset.
